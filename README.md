## Featured Projects

### Titration-RL Agent — Reinforcement Learning for Chemical Titration

A full-stack simulation using **PPO** and **Gymnasium** that trains an RL agent to perform automated weak acid-base titration with **zero prior data**. The agent learns to adaptively control base addition using only visual feedback from a pH indicator, operating under realistic constraints (50mL burette limit) and partial observability.

**Key Features:**
- Physics-accurate titration environment (Henderson-Hasselbalch, buffer chemistry, weak base hydrolysis)
- Partial observability: agent only sees indicator color (RGB), not true pH
- Reliability-based early stopping: training stops when ≥90% success rate achieved
- Interactive React dashboard with live agent trajectory visualization
- Asymmetric reward shaping to prevent overshooting

**Tech:** Python, PPO, Stable-Baselines3, Gymnasium, React, TypeScript, NumPy, Matplotlib

**Repo:** [chem-rl-indicator](https://github.com/TonyOdhiambo-47/chem-rl-indicator)
